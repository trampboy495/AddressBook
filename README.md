# AddressBook
Simple Address Book java swing application performing all basic cred and file handling operations.
For gui part I am using Java Swing Components and For File Handling, basic java IO file opeartions.
The object of POJO class are stored in linked list which is not a predefined java Linkedlist.
I have tired to build code using predefined utilities as less as possible.
I am storing data in json format and using gson library for it. 
Program can be improved further and suggestions for that are welcomed.
